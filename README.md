# Oh hey, it's my portfolio repo

I had a great time creating this minimalistic portfolio with Next.js and Chakra UI. Originally inspired by [this](https://github.com/manuarora700/simple-developer-portfolio-website) tutorial site.

## Features

- Responsive layout that reacts to multiple breakpoints.
- Dark/Light mode that automatically configures to the OS settings of the viewer.
- Super Dark Mode (I had soooo much fun with this one ðŸ˜„).
- Utilizes a custom Chakra theme for maintainability.

## Tech Stack

- Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
- Styled with [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).
- Highlight and underline effects via [React Rough Notation](https://roughnotation.com/).
- Tech stack icons from [Devicon](https://devicon.dev/).

## Takeaways

- This was an incredibly fun project and great way to learn Next and Vercel.
- I gained a much deeper understanding of advanced Chakra concepts and gained much more respect for how powerful and beautifully designed it is.
- Rough React Notation was a new package (to me) and I really enjoy using it to tie accent colors into a design.
